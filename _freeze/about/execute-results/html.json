He is interested in understanding how climate variability and atmospheric dynamics influence surface hydro-climatology, extreme climate events, and wildfires. Currently, his research work is focused on improving our understanding of how extreme weathers events occur and impact our forest, ecosystems, and communities. Previously he worked in research projects that investigated the role of atmospheric blocking on wildfires, lightning occurrences and wildfires, Atmospheric Rivers and their impacts on water resources,  climate change and their impacts, especially on the mountainous region of Himalayas and the Canadian Rockies, and climate change risk assessments.</p>\n<p>Aseem has worked as a Data Science Specialist at BC Ministry of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship and as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Canada Wildfire (Natural Resources Canada and the University of Alberta). Aseem earned his Ph.D. and master’s degrees from the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, BC, with grant support from Global Water Future and the BC Real Estate Foundation. He has co-authored over a dozen peer-reviewed articles and has presented his work at many scientific conferences and community events.

She has experience using complex ecological simulation models to explore fundamental and applied questions related to ecosystem stability to climate change, drought, fire, land-use changes and permafrost thaw. Her research is also strongly focused on the development of integrated, reusable and transparent modelling workflows that can be used not only for research purposes, but also to support and inform end-users within and beyond government. She earned her BSc in Biology from the University of Lisbon, Portugal, and an MSc in Ecology and Environmental Sustainability from the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. She later obtained her PhD in Biodiversity, Ecology and Environment from the University of Grenoble Alps, France, and was a post-doctoral fellow and research associate at the the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. Ceres is currently on the [British Ecological Society Macroecology SIG](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/membership-community/special-interest-groups/macroecology/) committee and on the [Response Diversity Network](https://responsediversitynetwork.github.io/RDN-website/who-we-are.html) committee, and is an Associate Editor for [Ecological Solutions and Evidence](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/26888319).
